# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-css-preview-engine/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Iframe Sandboxing Implementation
- Use React ref to manage iframe DOM element with `sandbox` attribute for security isolation
- Implement `srcdoc` attribute for injecting HTML content rather than external URL loading
- Configure Content Security Policy headers to prevent script execution and external resource loading
- Handle iframe onload events to ensure DOM readiness before CSS injection

### CSS Injection System
- Create CSS style element within iframe head using `contentDocument.createElement('style')`
- Implement debounced update mechanism using 150ms delay to optimize performance during rapid changes
- Use CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for dynamic value updates where applicable
- Maintain CSS rule priority and specificity for predictable style application

### Performance Optimization
- Implement React.memo for preview component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use useCallback hooks for event handlers to maintain referential equality
- Debounce CSS updates using lodash.debounce or custom implementation
- Lazy load iframe content to reduce initial bundle size and improve startup performance

### Sample HTML Template
- Create semantic HTML structure with common elements: headings, paragraphs, buttons, forms, lists
- Include diverse text content for typography testing
- Implement CSS class structure that supports color, background, gradient, and spacing modifications
- Design template to demonstrate visual hierarchy and responsive design principles

### Error Handling and Fallbacks
- Implement try-catch blocks around iframe manipulation for cross-origin security errors
- Provide fallback preview using div element if iframe fails to load or access is restricted
- Handle CSS parsing errors gracefully without breaking the preview functionality
- Log technical errors to console for debugging while maintaining user experience

### Browser Compatibility
- Support modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- Use feature detection for iframe sandbox support with graceful degradation
- Implement CSS custom property fallbacks for older browser versions
- Test cross-browser CSS rendering consistency for accurate preview representation
