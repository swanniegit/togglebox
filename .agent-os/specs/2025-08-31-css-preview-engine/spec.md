# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: CSS Preview Engine
> Created: 2025-08-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a real-time CSS preview engine that provides instant visual feedback for CSS property changes within a sandboxed iframe environment. This foundational feature enables users to see their styling changes immediately without switching between code and browser, forming the core infrastructure for all other ToggleBox features.

## User Stories

### Real-time CSS Visualization

As a web developer, I want to see CSS changes applied instantly to a preview area, so that I can iterate quickly on styling without manual refresh cycles.

The user modifies CSS properties through ToggleBox controls (color pickers, sliders, input fields) and immediately sees the visual result in a dedicated preview panel. The preview updates smoothly with debounced rendering to maintain performance while providing near-instant feedback on styling decisions.

### Safe CSS Testing Environment

As a designer experimenting with CSS, I want to test styles in an isolated environment, so that experimental changes don't interfere with the main application interface.

The preview engine renders CSS within a sandboxed iframe that prevents CSS from affecting the parent application while providing an authentic web page context for testing. Users can focus on creative exploration knowing their changes are contained and reversible.

### Professional CSS Output

As a developer integrating ToggleBox into my workflow, I want the preview to accurately represent how CSS will appear in production, so that I can trust the visual feedback for real-world implementation.

The preview engine renders CSS using standard web rendering with authentic font loading, spacing, and color representation that matches production browser behavior.

## Spec Scope

1. **Iframe-based Preview Rendering** - Isolated rendering environment using iframe sandboxing for security and style containment
2. **Real-time CSS Injection** - Dynamic CSS updating with 150ms debounced performance optimization
3. **Sample HTML Template** - Default HTML structure with common elements for comprehensive CSS testing
4. **CSS Property Support** - Core properties including colors, backgrounds, gradients, typography, spacing, borders
5. **Performance Optimization** - Efficient DOM updates and memory management for smooth real-time interaction

## Out of Scope

- Custom HTML upload functionality (future phase)
- Advanced CSS features like animations, transforms, or complex selectors
- Multiple breakpoint/responsive preview simultaneously
- CSS validation or error reporting
- Integration with external CSS frameworks initially

## Expected Deliverable

1. React component that renders an isolated preview iframe with sample HTML content
2. CSS injection system that updates iframe styles in real-time with debounced performance
3. Sample HTML template displaying typography, colors, backgrounds, and spacing elements for comprehensive testing
