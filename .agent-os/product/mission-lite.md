# Product Mission (Lite)

ToggleBox is a professional CSS stylesheet generator that helps web developers and designers create custom stylesheets through real-time visual testing and intuitive controls.

ToggleBox serves web developers who need efficient CSS creation workflows, UI/UX designers who want visual styling tools, and small business owners requiring professional web styling without deep CSS knowledge. Unlike traditional CSS development tools that require constant code-browser switching, ToggleBox provides instant visual feedback with comprehensive gradient controls, color management, and professional CSS export capabilities.
