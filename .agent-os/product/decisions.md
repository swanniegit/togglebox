## 2025-08-31: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

ToggleBox will be a professional CSS stylesheet generator focused on real-time visual feedback and intuitive controls. Target market includes web developers, UI/UX designers, and small business owners who need efficient CSS creation tools. Core features include real-time preview, advanced color/gradient controls, typography management, and professional CSS export.

### Context

The CSS development workflow is inefficient due to constant context switching between code editors and browsers. Designers with limited CSS knowledge are excluded from web implementation. Existing tools either require coding knowledge or provide insufficient customization options. Market opportunity exists for a professional tool combining visual controls with production-ready CSS output.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Code Editor Plugin**
   - Pros: Integrates with existing workflow, familiar environment
   - Cons: Limited visual feedback, still requires CSS knowledge, fragmented experience

2. **Browser Extension**
   - Pros: Works with any website, easy distribution
   - Cons: Limited UI space, browser compatibility issues, security restrictions

3. **Desktop Application**
   - Pros: Full control over UI, no browser limitations, offline capability
   - Cons: Platform-specific development, distribution complexity, update challenges

4. **Web-Based SaaS Platform**
   - Pros: Cross-platform compatibility, easy updates, collaborative features potential
   - Cons: Requires internet connection, subscription model needed for sustainability

### Rationale

Web-based application chosen for cross-platform compatibility and easy distribution. React selected for component-based architecture suitable for complex UI controls. Real-time preview prioritized as primary differentiator. Professional-grade export functionality essential for production adoption.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Broad market reach through web-based delivery
- Scalable architecture with React components
- Real-time feedback creates superior user experience
- Professional export ensures production viability

**Negative:**
- Requires internet connection for full functionality
- Complex real-time rendering may impact performance
- Professional features increase development complexity

## 2025-08-31: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Frontend: React 18.x with TypeScript, Vite build system, TailwindCSS for UI
Backend: Node.js 22 LTS for any API endpoints
Deployment: Digital Ocean App Platform with CloudFront CDN
No database required - CSS generation is stateless

### Context

Need modern, performant stack for complex UI with real-time updates. Tool requires sophisticated color controls, gradient builders, and instant CSS preview. Professional appearance essential for target market adoption.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Vue.js + Nuxt**
   - Pros: Excellent developer experience, built-in optimizations
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less suitable for complex control interfaces

2. **Svelte/SvelteKit**
   - Pros: Superior performance, smaller bundle size
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, fewer component libraries, learning curve

3. **Angular**
   - Pros: Full framework, excellent TypeScript support
   - Cons: Over-engineered for this use case, steeper learning curve

### Rationale

React chosen for mature ecosystem and excellent support for complex interactive components. Vite provides fast development experience crucial for iterative UI development. TailwindCSS enables rapid UI development while maintaining professional appearance. No database needed since CSS generation is stateless operation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast development cycle with React + Vite
- Professional UI achievable with TailwindCSS
- Stateless architecture simplifies deployment
- Strong community support for all technologies

**Negative:**
- React bundle size larger than alternatives
- TailwindCSS may require purging for production optimization
- Node.js backend may be overkill for simple use case

## 2025-08-31: Core Architecture Patterns

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement real-time CSS preview using React state management with immediate DOM updates. Use component composition for control panels. CSS generation through JavaScript template literals with optimization. Export functionality via browser download API.

### Context

Real-time preview is the core differentiator requiring immediate visual feedback. Complex control interfaces need reusable component architecture. CSS generation must produce clean, production-ready output.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **iframe-based Preview**
   - Pros: Complete isolation, true browser rendering
   - Cons: Communication complexity, slower updates, styling limitations

2. **Virtual CSS Processing**
   - Pros: Fast processing, easy optimization
   - Cons: May not match actual browser rendering, compatibility issues

3. **Server-side CSS Generation**
   - Pros: Powerful processing, optimization capabilities
   - Cons: Network latency breaks real-time experience, complexity

### Rationale

Direct DOM manipulation provides fastest visual feedback. Component composition allows complex control interfaces while maintaining code organization. Client-side CSS generation ensures real-time performance while keeping architecture simple.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Immediate visual feedback enhances user experience
- Component architecture supports complex UI requirements
- Client-side generation eliminates server dependencies
- Simple architecture reduces development and deployment complexity

**Negative:**
- Direct DOM manipulation may impact performance with complex styles
- Client-side processing limits optimization capabilities
- Browser compatibility issues must be handled client-side
